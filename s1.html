<p>Ethical hacking and ethical hacker are terms used to describe hacking performed by a company or individual to help identify potential threats on a computer or network.
An ethical hacker attempts to bypass system security and search for any weak points that could be exploited by malicious hackers.<br />
This information is then used by the organization to improve the system security, in an effort to minimize or eliminate any potential attacks.</p>
